## Directions

- 1D motor with smoothly varying intersurface potential function.

- Stall force against hard barriers.

- 2D modeling, where the dimensions may be PCs or other collective variables.

- How does surface articulation affect the functioning of the motors? (`surface-articulation`)

- Hydrodynamic calculations (see maybe `atp-power-propulsion`)

- Compute the Einstein force $F_\text{Einstein} = vD$ for drift velocity $v$ and diffusion coefficient $D$, or Einstein power $P_\text{Einstein} = v^2 D$ for flux on each surface.

- Efficiency (see `atp-power-propulsion`)

- Estimate the efficiency ... Compute the power dissipation of ATP hydrolysis (using
physiological [ATP], [ADP] and [Pi] and a realistic catalytic rate, and
convert this to a terminal velocity by using the fact that power
dissipation is F.v, where F is force and v is velocity, and that, for
viscous drag, v=F/d, where d is some drag coefficient for a protein.
Thus, we have P=F^2/d = d v^2 =power from atp hydrolysis, and we can
compute v.  If we get this number, we can then estimate that efficiency
and incomplete orientation might give an actual drift velocity maybe
1e-4 smaller than this upper limit...

- Model rotary jet system or turbine (for example, PMF of rotation for a CD)

- Torque of syntehtic motors

- Figure out how to make things more ratchet like (possibly using steps in the PMF)

- Coupling between torsions
