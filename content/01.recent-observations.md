## Recent observations

- Position dependent barrier (force-on-barrier-examples.pptx)

- Intrasurface flux is almost always opposite sign.

- JSD is not a good predictor of flux, nor is J_{symmetric}

- Reciprocating flux and directional flux have different responses to load
(`reciprocating-flux-vs-load`)

- RMSD doesn't clearly correlate with flux

- The force on a barrier can change signs, depending on barrier height *and* barrier position.

- Symmetry (or not) required, see discussion with Mudong
